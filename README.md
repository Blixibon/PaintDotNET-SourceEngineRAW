# Paint.NET Source Engine RAW plugin

This is a plugin for Paint.NET which adds support for saving and loading the simple color lookup tables used by the Source engine for color correction in the `.raw` format.

This is supposed to allow Paint.NET to serve as an alternative to the famous Photoshop color correction trick, where the lookup table is imposed on a screenshot of the map and adjustments are made within Photoshop itself, with the color lookup table being saved with those adjustments.
